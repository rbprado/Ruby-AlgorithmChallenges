Input Format

The first line contians the position x and y of the robot.

The next line contains the height and the width of the grid.ille.

The next lines represent the grid . Each cell is represented by one of those three characters:

    'b' for the position of the robot
    'd' for a dirty cell
    '-' for a clean cell

If the robot is on a dirty cell, the character 'd' will be used.
